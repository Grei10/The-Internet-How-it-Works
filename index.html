			<h1>Internet</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>The <b>greatest invention</b> known to mankind</p>
			

			<b><p>The invention I chose is the internet. It's a global system of interconnected computers that all communicate with each other. Through the internet, we're able to communicate with each other over vast distances and can exchange a great deal of information with anyone in the world.</p>

			</div>
			<p>I was born after the internet was created, and it's an innovation I find very important to me. It's also interesting to me because I use it all the time and constantly enjoy the convenience it brings me. I think it's really interesting to learn more about it since I use it all the time without really knowing too much about how it actually works.</p>

			<p>Having basically unlimited access to all the information in the world is definitely a big plus. It's helped me on countless school nights where I don't understand a lesson, so I'd pop over to SciShow or Wikipedia to learn more. It's also been a great source of entertainment, giving me access to things like multiplayer video games, Netflix, and social media.</p>

			<p>The web is actually categorized into generations. Web 1.0 was the "static web", where you could only read files and not actually create anything. Web 2.0 is the "semantic web", where you could actually create content yourself and upload it like in YouTube or Facebook -- people are suddenly able to interact a lot more and not just read stuff like in a library. There's also actually a lot of talk about Web 3.0, and it uses cool technology like blockchain to "decentralize" the web and share it with everyone. That way, the web belongs to everyone and not just a few companies like Google or Amazon. </p>

				<p>Companies and services that make use of the internet.</p>
			</div>
			<p>We use the internet for a lot of things like entertainment and convenience. Google is definitely a big thing, and it's great that you could have any question at all and Google would have a pretty good answer. People also use the internet for high-speed communication. This applies to things like chatting in social media, but it also applies to stuff like news, streaming, game updates, and books. </p>
             
			<p>I think that without the internet, we'd be much less connected. The fastest way to communicate might be by radio or telephone, and you'd have much less access to the world. I think that's good for things like being able to go outside and enjoy the "real world", but you also sacrifice a lot by not having access to the wealth of information that the internet provides.</p></b>
